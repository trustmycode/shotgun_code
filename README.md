‚Üí Paste it into **Google AI Studio** and receive a massive patch for your code. 25 free queries per day!
‚Üí Drop that patch into Cursor or Windsurf and apply the entire diff in a single request.

**That means you get 25 huge, fully coherent patches per day for your codebase‚Äîabsolutely free, thanks to complete context transfer.**

Perfect for dynamically-typed languages:

Python
JavaScript

# Shotgun App

_One‚Äëclick codebase "blast" for Large‚ÄëLanguage‚ÄëModel workflows._

## 1. What Shotgun Does

Shotgun is a tiny desktop tool that **explodes an entire project into a single,
well‚Äëstructured text payload** designed for AI assistants.
Think of it as a rapid‚Äëfire alternative to copy‚Äëpasting dozens of files by hand:

- **Select a folder ‚Üí get an instant tree + file dump**
  in a predictable delimiter format (`*#*#*...*#*#*begin ‚Ä¶ *#*#*end*#*#*`).
- **Tick check‚Äëboxes to exclude noise** (logs, build artifacts, `node_modules`, ‚Ä¶).
- **Paste the result into ChatGPT, Gemini 2.5, Cursor, etc.**
  to ask for multi‚Äëfile edits, refactors, bug fixes, reviews, or documentation.
- **Receive a diff‚Äëstyle reply** and apply changes with your favourite patch tool.

Shotgun trades surgical, single‚Äëfile prompts for a **"whole‚Äërepository blast"** ‚Äì
hence the name.

## 2. Why You Might Need It

| Scenario                       | Pain Point                                     | Shotgun Benefit                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bulk bug fixing**            | "Please fix X across 12 files."                | Generates a complete snapshot so the LLM sees all usages.  |
| **Large‚Äëscale refactor**       | IDE refactors miss edge cases.                 | LLM gets full context and returns a patch set.             |
| **On‚Äëboarding review**         | New joiner must understand legacy code.        | Produce a single, searchable text file to discuss in chat. |
| **Doc generation**             | Want docs/tests for every exported symbol.     | LLM can iterate over full source without extra API calls.  |
| **Cursor / CodePilot prompts** | Tools accept pasted context but no filesystem. | Shotgun bridges the gap.                                   |

## 4. How It Works

(This describes the UI flow. The core `GenerateShotgunOutput` Go function remains the primary backend logic for creating the text payload based on the selected root and exclusions.)

1. **Step 1: Prepare Context**
    - User selects a project folder.
    - The file tree is displayed in the `LeftSidebar`.
    - User can mark files/folders for exclusion.
    - The application automatically (or via a button) triggers context generation in Go (`GenerateShotgunOutput`).
    - The resulting context (tree + file contents) is stored in `shotgunPromptContext` and passed to `CentralPanel.vue`, which in turn makes it available to `Step2GenerateDiff.vue`.
2. **Step 2: Compose Prompt**
    - `Step2GenerateDiff.vue` is shown.
    - It displays the `shotgunPromptContext` (likely in a read-only textarea).
    - User types their instructions for the LLM into another textarea (the prompt).
    - User clicks "Compose Prompt" (was "Generate Diff").
    - `MainLayout.vue` (simulates) sending the `shotgunPromptContext` and the user's prompt to an LLM.
    - (Simulated) LLM returns a diff, which is then displayed in the "Diff Viewer" section of `Step2GenerateDiff.vue`.
3. **Step 3: Execute Prompt**
    - `Step3ExecuteDiff.vue` is shown.
    - User clicks "Execute Prompt" (was "Execute Diff").
    - `MainLayout.vue` (simulates) the "execution" of this prompt/diff. This step is more conceptual in the current stubbed implementation but would represent running or applying the changes indicated by the LLM.
    - Logs appear in the step-specific console within `Step3ExecuteDiff.vue` and/or the `BottomConsole.vue`.
4. **Step 4: Apply Patch**
    - `Step4ApplyPatch.vue` is shown.
    - User interacts with a (currently stubbed) patch editor.
    - User clicks "Apply Selected" or "Apply All & Finish".
    - `MainLayout.vue` (simulates) applying these patches.

## 5. Installation

### 5.1. Prerequisites

- **Go ‚â• 1.20** `go version`
- **Node.js LTS** `node -v`

### 5.4. Build a Release

```bash
wails build           # binaries land in build/bin/
```

## 6. Quick‚ÄëStart Workflow

1. Run `wails dev`. The app window will open.
2. **Step 1: Prepare Context**
    - Click "Select Project Folder" and choose your repository root.
    - In the left pane (`LeftSidebar`), expand folders and un-tick any items you wish to exclude from the context.
    - Click the "Prepare Project Context & Proceed" button (typically in `Step1CopyStructure.vue` or a similar area for Step 1).
    - The generated context (project tree and file contents) will be prepared internally.
3. **Step 2: Compose Prompt**
    - The view will switch to Step 2 (`Step2GenerateDiff.vue`).
    - The generated project context from Step 1 will be displayed (usually read-only).
    - Enter your instructions for the LLM in the "Prompt Editor" textarea.
    - Click "Compose Prompt".
    - A (mock) diff will be generated and shown in the "Diff Viewer".
4. **Step 3: Execute Prompt**
    - The view will switch to Step 3 (`Step3ExecuteDiff.vue`).
    - Click "Execute Prompt".
    - (Mock) execution logs will appear in the console areas.
5. **Step 4: Apply Patch**
    - The view will switch to Step 4 (`Step4ApplyPatch.vue`).
    - Interact with the (stubbed) patch editor.
    - Click "Apply Selected" or "Apply All & Finish" to (simulate) completing the process.
6. You can navigate between completed steps using the top `HorizontalStepper` or the `LeftSidebar` step list.

## 7. Shotgun Output Anatomy

```text
app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.go
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.vue
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ FileTree.vue (example)

<file path="main.go">
package main
...
</file>

<file path="frontend/components/FileTree.vue">
<template>
...
</template>
</file>
```

- **Tree View** ‚Äì quick visual map for you & the LLM.
- **XML-like File Blocks** ‚Äì <file path="path/to/file">...</file> for easy parsing by models.

## 8. Best Practices

- **Trim the noise** ‚Äì exclude lock files, vendored libs, generated assets.
  Less tokens ‚Üí cheaper & more accurate completions.
- **Ask for diffs, not whole files** ‚Äì keeps responses concise.
- **Iterate** ‚Äì generate ‚Üí ask ‚Üí patch ‚Üí re‚Äëgenerate if needed.
- **Watch token limits** ‚Äì even million‚Äëtoken models have practical caps.
  Use Shotgun scopes (root folder vs subfolder) to stay under budget.

## 9. Troubleshooting

| Symptom                     | Fix                                                            |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `wails: command not found`  | Ensure `$GOROOT/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` is on `PATH`.           |
| Blank window on `wails dev` | Check Node version & reinstall frontend deps.                  |
| Output too large            | Split Shotgun runs by subdirectory; or exclude binaries/tests. |
